          Includes the core foundation capabilities provided by large ERP

          applications. ERP foundation platforms (like SAP R/3 Basis or SAP S/4
          HANA) are the technical underpinning that enables the ERP application
          to function. Typically consists of programs and tools that support the
          interoperability and portability of ERP applications across systems
          and databases. Many SaaS applications also provide a platform
          capability to enable integration and development of additional
          applications or modules that complement the primary application suite.
          Examples include Salesforce’s Force.com product, ServiceNow’s Now
          Platform and Appian.
