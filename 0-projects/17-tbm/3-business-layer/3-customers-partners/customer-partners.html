          Refers to the customers and partners of the enterprise, not those
          internal customers and partners of the IT/tech provider. Customers
          refers to the individuals (B2B) and companies (B2C) for which the
          enterprise primarily exists to serve and from which the enterprise
          earns revenue or other funding (e.g., government funding, donations).
          Partners refers to the external business entities with which the
          enterprise collaborates to drive business outcomes.

        <div class="card__3a">
          The groupings of products and services provided by the enterprise to
          customers and/or through partners (e.g., resellers). Often refers to
          technology-based products and services that are built directly on top
          of (or out of) solutions, but may also represent the solution-related
          resources needed to deliver non-technology based products and
          services. (Non-technology based products and services would often be
          represented by revenue-generating business units instead.)

        <div class="card__4a">
          The system or combination of systems that are used to directly engage
          and serve customers and partners of the enterprise. May include mobile
          app based platforms used to promote and sell physical products or to
          socially engage customers and prospective customers or other external
          users.
